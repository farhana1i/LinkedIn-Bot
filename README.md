# LinkedIn-Bot

It is hectic to manually send connection requests to a lot of people on LinkedIn. To solve this problem, I have created a LinkedIn bot that can help you grow your LinkedIn profile.

This bot aims to visit all the profiles in your profile's recommendation list and send them a connection request. 

## Resources
Python, Selenium, PyQt5, chromedriver, BeautifulSoup

For automation, I am using the Python Selenium module. GUI is done with the help of the PyQt5 library. BeautifulSoup is for scraping profile links on the web.

## Installation
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Also, make sure to keep ```chromedriver``` in the same directory as the code.

## How to execute the bot?

    1.  Download the zip file of the project
    2.  Extract the downloaded folder.
    3.  Open the command prompt.
    4.  Go to the directory where you've downloaded the folder.
    5.  Type "python LinkedIn-Bot.py"
    6.  Hit Enter.
    7.  A dialog box will appear.
    8.  Enter your LinkedIn credentials (username and password).
    9.  Click on submit button.
    10. Wait and see.
